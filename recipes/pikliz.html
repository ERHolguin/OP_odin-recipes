            <h2> <strong> Haitian Pikliz (pickled carrots & cabbage)</h2> </strong>
        </p>

        <p>This well-known Haitian condiment is traditionally served with 
            meat and frites (fried food). If you so please, you can also enjoy
            it with other sides such as rice and beans, as many locals of
            Haiti do.

                    but you will have to slice the cabbage yourself.

                <li>2 tbsp Salt</li>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, olive oil, salt, 
                    and sliced peppers (you may add more or less peppers as 
                    you see fit). Mix well with a spoon or whisk until the 
                    salt has desolved almost entirely. <strong>Do not add 
                    any water</strong>. Use a fork to crush the peppers a bit to bring out 
                    their flavors, then set aside.</li>
                <li>Use a kitchen knife to thinly slice the cabbage.</li> 
                <li>In a medium bowl, add the sliced cabbage and the shredded 
                    carrots, then combine thoroughly with a fork.
                <li> Add the lime juice to the mixture, leaving out the sliced 
                    peppers (<strong>Do discard them!</strong>) and mix again.</li> 
                <li>Put the sliced peppers in a 16 oz jar, then add the cabbage 
                    and carrots mixture on top, including the lime juice. Close
                    the jar and Shake well until the mixture is fully soaked. 
                    Leave out overnight at room temperature, then refrigerate.</li> 
            </ol>
